# Blather

Blather is the app for fans that love to express their thoughts and reactions about the media they consume. Whether you're the type to spam texts to your friends or live-tweet in the moment, the type to collect your thoughts and write out a more edited post in hindsight, or somewhere in between, Blather encourages any and all kinds of fandom expression! 

Though Blather was created with media such as movies, serialized shows, books, and video games in mind, this is by no means a limitation! Use Blather as a personal journal, a habit tracker, track progress on that new hobby you picked up, keep notes on athletes' performance during a season for your fantasy games, whatever you can think of! The "thread" format of Blather posts allows for clear chronology for any topic, limited only by your own interests!
